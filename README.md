# Practice Coding/Algorithms from Various Sources

Been working mostly in tensorflow/numpy lately, so I thought it would be fun
to go back to some basics to stay sharp. I'm comparing a few practice coding
or interview prep sites to see which ones have better problems and interfaces.

The beginning problems are all pretty similar and super easy, so it seems like
a good method of comparing the sites in an apples-to-apples way as possible.
